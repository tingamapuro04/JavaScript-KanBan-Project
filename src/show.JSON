These ingenious killers are every detective's worst nightmare. Whether by planting false evidence, or writing anonymous letters to police, these murderers will stop at nothing to stay one step ahead and get away with the perfect murder. In this program, we focus on the investigation, as detectives slowly put the pieces together to unravel the twisted truth. As detectives uncover new evidence, and turn to new suspects, we flashback through stylized reenactment, to depict each possible theory of what may have happened.</p>",

The number 5113 in the series title refers to the extension telephone number of the head of SOKO. The series is based on memories of crime director Dieter Schenk, who put it down in 1975. The manuscript was also published as a novel entitled \"Der Durchläufer\" (Frankfurt 1978). Schenk was head of the Gießen criminal police and later worked for the Federal Criminal Police Office. Since 1978, the basic concept of the series has been to show the criminal police work as realistically as possible without working with the exaggerations and exaggerations common in other crime series. The teamwork is in the foreground, the personal life of the characters is also integrated into the plot.</p>",

    "summary": "<p><i><b>\"One Bad Choice\"</b></i> is a 10-episode series that explores the consequences of young people who made a single, terrible decision that irrevocably changed their lives forever. Each 60-minute program focuses in-depth on a true story that's narrated by the actual participants and includes recreations with actors to portray the events that occurred. In this first season of 'One Bad Choice,' viewers will be introduced to a wide range of stories, situations, and people who've had their lives upended by a single lapse in judgment. Participants include Dona, who as a high school student took Ecstasy with a friend and suffered dire consequences as a result; Levi, a teenager who became unwittingly involved in a robbery that ended in tragedy; Meili, who blindly became part of an enormous illegal drug-selling operation; Kumari, a bright college student who exacted revenge on a boyfriend in a way that she'll regret for the rest of her life; and Michelle, a young woman whose fake pregnancy to gain attention for herself spiraled out of control in unimaginable ways. Shocking, surprising, and deeply emotional, 'One Bad Choice' serves up highly emotional, cautionary tales that take viewers on a roller coaster ride filled with shocking twists and turns, suspense, drama, and redemption.</p>",

And the evidence they have gathered leads them to the one place no one dares to go, a remote, treacherous island teeming with thousands of deadly vipers. Its name: Queimada Grande, known to locals as Snake Island.</p><p>The legendary bounty that launched this quest, known as the \"Treasure of the Trinity,\" has eluded all who have sought it for almost 500 years. In the 16th century, Portuguese conquistadors cut their way through uncharted Brazilian jungles and reportedly stole a vast horde of Incan gold. Ever since, people have spilled blood, burned villages, and evaded marauding pirates to hold on to this treasure, but it vanished into history.</p><p>Now, armed with advanced technology, our team of explorers will have to unearth and solve a number of complex clues that have protected the treasure for centuries. But most of all, they'll need nerves of steel as they brave modern-day pirates, perilous weather, and one of the most dangerous places in the world, where one misstep could cost them not just incredible riches, but ultimately their lives on <b>Treasure Quest</b>.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>This documentary illustrates Hitler's ruthless aspirations and savage victories, as his armies blitzed their way through Northern Europe and invaded the Soviet Union; the disappointment and defeat that followed the collapse of his \"Russian Adventure,\" and the Allies closing in on the German capital of Berlin. Hitler's fateful decision to invade the Soviet Union proved to be the decisive turning point that led to his defeat in Europe. Though 1941's successful Operation Barbarossa netted huge swaths of Soviet territory, the Nazis' attempt on Moscow was derailed by the harsh Russian winter, while the subsequent Battle of Stalingrad completely destroyed Nazi forces. Both of these disastrous campaigns ultimately led to the weakening of both the German military and Hitler's own psyche, resulting in the Allies' march into Berlin and the Fuhrer's suicide shortly thereafter.</p>",

During the shows first season, Paris and Nicole got a reality check when they learned what it was really like to live among the middle-class as they moved from their posh Beverly Hills pads to the small town of Altus, Arkansas (population 817) for a one-month stay. Paris and Nicole were horribly inept at their jobs, which were the first they had ever had-including gigs at a dairy farm and a fast-food joint. But pretty soon they were up to their old tricks, picking up guys and causing mischief along the way, all in an effort to spice up the lives of their small town family and to win the hearts of the town's simple, kind-hearted residents. In the end, the girls survived the challenge, and most certainly served to prove that you can take the girl out of the city...</p>",

The show follows him as he tries to perform incredibly well-thought-out and elaborate practical jokes, or pranks, on people. He lives in the fictional town of East Gackle. He constantly breaks the fourth wall when the screen freezes. Andy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His enemies include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney (in the books her name is Lisa Mackney) and usually tries to impress her. The show is based on Andy Griffiths' children's series of Just... books (which were illustrated by Terry Denton), although many episodes are not directly based on the books. Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.</p>",

They are performed in a way that deconstructs comedy itself; literally a vehicle for Lee's idiosyncratic style. Starring alongside Stewart are: Tony Law, Tara Flynn, Paul Putner, Kevin Eldon, Miles Jupp, Simon Munnery, Job Angus and Michael Redmond. Peter Serafinowicz provides voiceovers.</p>",

This series follows a handful of survivalists as they hunt for food, drill for water, trade for necessities and protect their turf. It's a lawless frozen lake of ultra-libertarians forced together during brutal winters. Choosing another kind of lifestyle, these rebels – families, couples and singles – have said goodbye to living life the conventional way on land and taken to floating homes and houseboats… Since they don't live on land, they don't pay taxes, and, therefore, no one polices them. The very things that we take for granted – from opening the front door to walking your pet to shopping for groceries and supplies – are incredibly difficult to navigate. As one rebel says, \"It's not man you have to worry about; it's woman – Mother Nature.</p>",

Whitney's chagrin, the possible re-emergence of \"The Ghost\" has brought FBI Special Agent Harrison Pearce into the case, who is holding a few secrets of his own.

When Isaac's territory is threatened by the Cordero family, events turn deadlier than anyone had imagined.

They work out of a sprawling garage, Welder Up, on the outskirts of the Las Vegas Strip, re-building one-of-a-kind Mad Max-style \"rat rod\" cars out of hidden treasure for quirky customers. An expert picker, Darnell finds hidden treasure buried in junkyards, farmers' fields and swap meets. He and his crew assemble his finds into rolling works of auto-art. In each episode of <b>Vegas Rat Rods</b>, creativity and imagination are taken to the next level as each rat rod created represents the person it is being made for. From a shotgun gearshift and mason jar tail lights, to death row electric chair car seats and horseshoe gas peddles, each rat rod featured on Vegas Rat Rods is equal parts discarded treasure, high-tech performance parts and wild imagination from Darnell and his entire team.</p>",

    "summary": "<p>In 1860, as the American Experiment threatened to explode into a bloody civil war, there were as many as four hundred thousand slave-owners in the United States, and almost four million slaves. The nation was founded upon the idea that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The nation would pay a bloody cost for denying that right to more than twelve percent of its population. But when slavery was first brought to America's shores, this war, and even the nation it tore apart, was centuries in the future. With incredibly detailed historical reenactments, expert commentary and the stories of slavery told through first-hand accounts, this is an epic struggle 400 years in the making. A journey into the past like none other. This is the story of these men and women who by their hands laid the foundation of what would become the most powerful nation on Earth. Join us as we rise...UP FROM SLAVERY.

Ferocious drive, innovation and often sheer recklessness took these visionaries to the top of the rich-and-powerful list and ultimately made America the mightiest nation on earth. Despite their wealth and power, these titans of industry and captains of commerce were not always philanthropic, often driven by greed, ambition, jealousy and revenge. You can't build a fortune without making a few enemies. From Edison and Tesla's high-voltage war of the currents to Rockefeller and Scott's row over the growth of oil, <b>American Titans</b> relies on cinematic recreations and expert commentary to reveal what it took for the founding fathers of the Fortune 500 to steer the Industrial Revolution into the Gilded Age. During this era of incredible industrial potential, there were many on the road to absolute power – these are the stories of those who out-fought, out-spent, and out-smarted their rivals to reserve their chapter in the history books and make America what it is today.</p>",

In the past we've seen him give being a family man his all, but sometimes in life and love other cards come into play. Now, in the new series <b>She's Got Game</b>, The Game sets out in pursuit of his perfect love match.</p><p>After splitting with his long-time fiance?e, double platinum selling rapper Jayceon \"The Game\" Taylor is back on the market and ready to meet the woman of his dreams. However, The Game doesn't do anything ordinary and dating is no exception. Over the course of 10 one hour episodes on <i>She's Got Game</i> the rebounding rapper will ask his closest celebrity friends to set him up with his perfect match. And because nothing tests compatibility quite like travel, before the 10 women can say, \"I'm not here to make friends\", they'll be hitting the road with The Game on a cross-country tour.</p><p>At the outset of the series, 10 of The Game's celebrity friends will be tapped as matchmakers. Each of these celebs (men and women), will put forward who they believe to be his perfect girl. Whether it is a beauty from the Bronx or a corn-fed farmer's daughter in Kansas, the celebrities are free to choose any woman they think will win The Game's heart. With his future in mind and each celeb's pride on the line, you'd best believe that the stakes are high.</p><p>Throughout the series, The Game and the girls will travel in style from LA to Miami and everything in between via private jet, tour bus, boat, and of course - luxury cars. In each city they'll get to know The Game better by going on extraordinary dates, seeing the city, and making connections with him. The girls will learn to live life on the road to see what his life is really like as The Game performs and makes appearances in cities all across America. In every city, the party ends for one of our girls who is sent packing. In the end, only one woman will be able to say <i>\"She's Got Game\"</i>.</p>",

The series follows 26-year-old Dana Cody, the glamorous and sassy owner of Tippie Toes Beauty Lounge in Miami. A no-nonsense boss, Dana is determined to continue the legacy her mother left behind by building an empire one nail at a time. Each half-hour episode features Dana's eccentric and sometimes unruly staff as they create custom, one-of-a-kind fantasy nail art for her equally unique and demanding clients. From a dancer that wants nails as fierce as her stilettos to an artist with an alter-ego who wishes to have a set filled with personality, the requests are over-the-top but no one ever leaves disappointed.</p>",

In the history of television, a higher stakes battle for dominance has never been waged! In Man v Fly, Brave human warriors are placed into a sealed white box with a cunning, dastardly housefly. Every contestant is allowed one weapon of choice to aid in battle: a cleaning lady wields her vacuum, a knight in armor swings his broadsword, a scuba diver brandishes a fish. Each has only 60 seconds to bring down the fly, or leave in disgrace. Two will enter…but only one will leave. Off-camera sports commentators announce the play-by-play with hysterically deadpan wit. Cheering for the fly is encouraged.</p>",
